# todoreact

This is a simple TODO app using reactjs. It is still **WIP** :upside_down_face: and is currently not hooked up with the backend.
The card data is currently hard coded and you will loose it after the session.

## Getting started

1. To start the app, navigate to the app path in the terminal and run :
   ` npm install && npm run start`
2. To start the server navigat to the server path in the terminal and run :
   `npm install && npm run start`

## Tech Used

**APP - FrontEnd**

1. React
   - react dnd - drop and drop
   - useContext hooks
2. Css modules

**SERVER**

1. Express
2. Mongodb

## Still to do

1. Write the server code
2. Improve css :scream:
3. refactor main panel component
